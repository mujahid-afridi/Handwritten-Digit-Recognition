# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a **Streamlit web app** for recognizing handwritten digits using three models:

- **Perceptron**: Simple neural network  
- **ANN**: Multi-layer neural network  
- **CNN**: Convolutional Neural Network (best accuracy)  

Users can **upload a 28x28 grayscale image** of a handwritten digit and see predictions from all three models.

## Features

- Upload 28x28 grayscale digit images
- Processed preview of uploaded image
- Predictions from Perceptron, ANN, and CNN
- Clean and intuitive Streamlit UI with sidebar descriptions
